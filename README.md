# Wordle Solver

[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) is all the rage, but as my co-workers will attest to, I suck at it. So I built a solver!

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yasyf/wordle-solver.git
cd wordle-solver

bundle install
./wordle_solver.rb
```

### Usage

The solver is full interactive. Simply run it and go!
